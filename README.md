**Chrome extension to hide Airbnb listings you don't like.**

Tired of looking through the same Airbnb listing for the fifth time, trying to remember what was bad? Just hide it from all search results! This extension adds a small button to each listing in Airbnb's search results, which lets you hide it. Preserved across reruns, navigating between pages, changing the map, etc.
